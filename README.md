<h2>Role Playing Game</h2>

<p>Simple RPG made with C#, .NET 6.0 and i'm thinking on using some database to keep a player's progress.</p>

<p>Had a really good time making this game and it was more difficult than what i expected wich makes it even more entertaining.</p>

<p>I keep studying to make even better projects.</p>
